# Softmax exercise

*Complete and hand in this completed worksheet (including its outputs and any supporting code outside of the worksheet) with your assignment submission. For more details see the [assignments page](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/assignments.html) on the course website.*

This exercise is analogous to the SoftMax exercise. You will:

- implement a fully-vectorized **loss function** for the Softmax classifier
- implement the fully-vectorized expression for its **analytic gradient**
- **check your implementation** with numerical gradient
- use a validation set to **tune the learning rate and regularization** strength
- **optimize** the loss function with **SGD**
- **visualize** the final learned weights

## Softmax Classifier

Your code for this section will all be written inside **cs231n/classifiers/softmax.py**.
